# Analyzing the Impact of ENSO Phases on Precipitation Patterns
By Casey Yuan
# Introduction
Precipitation is the most important and active variable associated with atmospheric circulation in weather and climate studies. Understanding the connection between climate trends and precipitation patterns is essential for managing water resources and predicting extreme weather events. One key factor driving climate variability is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which significantly impacts global precipitation and temperature patterns. In this project, I explore the impact of ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral) on precipitation patterns using the University of Delaware’s long-term precipitation data and the ENSO climate index.
