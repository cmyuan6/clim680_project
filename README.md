# Analyzing the Impact of ENSO Phases on Precipitation Patterns
By Casey Yuan
# Introduction
Precipitation is the most important and active variable associated with atmospheric circulation in weather and climate studies. Understanding the connection between climate trends and precipitation patterns is essential for managing water resources and predicting extreme weather events. One key factor driving climate variability is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which significantly impacts global precipitation and temperature patterns. In this project, I explore the impact of ENSO phases (El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral) on precipitation patterns using the University of Delaware’s long-term precipitation data and the ENSO climate index.
# Data
The datasets used in my project are:
## University of Delaware Terrestrial Precipitation, from 1900/01 to 2014/12
Cort Willmott and Kenji Matsuura from the University of Delaware compiled data from a wide range of stations. The UDEL-TS dataset includes rain gauges from several sources, such as the Global Historical Climatology Network, the Daily Global Historical Climatology Network, the Atmospheric Environment Service archive, the Hydrometeorological Institute, GC-Net, and other regional and global networks. The GPCC and CRU-TS datasets provide similar temporal coverage and resolution, but they primarily rely on data from national meteorological agencies, the WMO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization. Unlike UDEL-TS and CRU-TS, which use cross-validation and outlier detection, the GPCC dataset requires at least 10 years of continuous data for each station to be included.
It is a global gridded monthly land precipitation and temperature dataset.
## ENSO Precipitation Index, from 1979 to 2023
Time series that uses rainfall data from the Tropical Pacific to characterize ENSO events. This climate index measures the precipitation anomalies associated with El Niño and La Niña conditions. The index is widely used in climate studies to track ENSO phases and their associated precipitation variations across the Pacific region.
